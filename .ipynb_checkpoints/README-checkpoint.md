# Implementing-basic-ML-methods-on-titanic
In this, Jupyter notebook, I used the titanic dataset in seaborn. I used basic and known machine learnin methods to predict the survival of passengers in titanic. In class we have done with decision tree and random forest when the data was scaled. So I decided to check does really help us? The answer, yes it does slightly. Table 1 shows ML models without scaled, Table 2 shows with ML models with scaling, Table 3 shows ML models with scaled data set and grid search.
